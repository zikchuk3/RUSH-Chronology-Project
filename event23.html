<h2>1860 – Secession </h2>

<p>
The Secession of the Southern states from the United States occurred in a period from 1860 to 1861, starting with South Carolina in 1860, forming the Confederate Union. The main driver of the Secession was primarily to preserve, maintain, and expand the institution of slavery and the economic, social, and political system built around it in the South.  After Abraham Lincoln’s win in the Election of 1860, Southern states were organizing secession convention within days, fearing that he may limit or abolish slavery. Within days of the inauguration of the Confederacy’s president in 1961, Confederate rebels opened fire at Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and the Civil War officially began between the Northern and Southern states. The Secession highlights the extreme division slavery had caused within the American Empire.
