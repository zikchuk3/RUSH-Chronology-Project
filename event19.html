<h1> American Empire</h1>
<h2>1964 – Tonkin Gulf Resolution</h2>

<p>
The Tonkin Gulf Resolution was passed by Congress in August 1964 after reports that the USS Maddox had been attacked by North Vietnamese patrol boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. The resolution granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to use military force to defend South Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. This event connects to the United States’ Cold War policy of containment, as the United States sought to stop the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution demonstrates American imperial power by enabling prolonged military intervention abroad under the justification of protecting U.S. interests and allies.
