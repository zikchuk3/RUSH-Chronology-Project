<h1> American Empire</h1>
<h2>1941 – Pearl Harbor</h2>

<p>
On December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, killing approximately 2,400 Americans. The attack severely damaged the U.S. Pacific Naval Fleet and shocked the nation. This event connects to U.S. economic policies toward Japan, including the embargo on oil and other vital resources, which aimed to limit Japan’s war in the Pacific and imperial expansion in Asia. Japan viewed these embargoes as de factor declarations of war and responded with a planned strike to weaken American power in the Pacific. The attack on Pearl Harbor marked the end of American isolationism and propelled the United States into global warfare, accelerating its rise as a dominant imperial and world power.
