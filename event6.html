<h2>1774 – Intolerable/ Coercive Acts</h2>

<p>
The Intolerable or Coercive Acts were a series of laws passed by British Parliament between March and June of 1774 to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party. These Acts closed the port of Boston, restricted town meetings, and replaced colonial government with one controlled by Britain. The goal was to isolate Massachusetts and make it a warning to the other colonies. Instead of this, the Acts had the opposite effect. The other colonies united in support, sending food, supplies, and more to Massachusetts. This led to the first Continental Congress in 1774, where representatives from many colonies met to coordinate a response to British rule. The Intolerable Acts played a direct role in increasing colonial unity and resistance by fostering a sense of shared identity between the colonies, setting the stage for the American Revolution.
