<h2>1968 – Tet Offensive</h2>

<p>
The Tet Offensive began in January 1968, when North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces launched coordinated attacks on more than one hundred U.S. and South Vietnamese targets across South Vietnam, including the U.S. embassy in Saigon. Although American and South Vietnamese troops ultimately repelled the attacks, the scale and surprise of the offensive shocked the public. This event connects directly to the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which had allowed President Johnson to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. Tet revealed that the expanded military commitment authorized in 1964 had failed to achieve its stated goals. The Tet Offensive exposed the limits of American imperial power by demonstrating that military dominance abroad could not guarantee political control or public support at home.
