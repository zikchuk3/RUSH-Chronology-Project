<h2>1948 – Marshall Plan</h2>

<p>
The Marshall Plan, also known as the European Recovery Program, was a U.S. initiative that provided approximately $13 billion to help rebuild Western Europe after World War II from 1948 to 1952. It was proposed by General George Marshall in a 1947 speech at Harvard University. The Marshall planned allowed the U.S. to practice the concept of containment, as the United States sought to prevent the spread of communism by stabilizing Western European economies. The plan also expanded American economic influence by opening European markets to U.S. goods and investment. The Marshall Plan showed how the United States used economic aid to shape foreign governments and establish global influence without direct military control.
