<h1> American Empire</h1>
<h2>1838 – Trail of Tears (Cherokee)</h2>

<p>
The Trail of Tears was the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation, along with other Native American tribes, from their ancestral lands in Georgia and the southeastern United States to territory west of the Mississippi River (present-day Oklahoma) during 1838–1839. This removal was carried out by the United States government under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, signed by President Andrew Jackson, which authorized the relocation of Native tribes from lands desired by white settlers. Despite intense pressure and threats of violence from white Georgians, the Cherokee Nation adopted many Euro-American practices in an effort to be recognized as “civilized” and to protect their sovereignty and land. However, this assimilation did not prevent their removal. The Trail of Tears demonstrates the extent of American imperial power within the continent, revealing how cultural assimilation offered no protection to the Native peoples and that U.S. expansion was justified through racial hierarchies that portrayed Indigenous populations as inferior.
