<h2>1848 – Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo</h2>

<p>
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2, 1848, and officially ended the Mexican American War (1846–1848). Under the treaty, Mexico was forced to cede nearly half of its national territory to the United States, including land that would later become California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, and parts of Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming. This event connects to the concept of Manifest Destiny, which justified U.S. expansion as both inevitable and divinely ordained. It also reflects President James Polk’s expansionist goals and the use of military force to achieve territorial growth. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo demonstrates American imperial power by showing how the United States used war and unequal treaties to expand its territory and influence at the expense of another nation, and helped the United States state step on the path to becoming a world power.
