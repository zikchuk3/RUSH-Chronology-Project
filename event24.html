<h2>1863 – Emancipation Proclamation  </h2>

<p>
The Emancipation Proclamation was the decisive moment by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1,1863, that declared that enslaved people in Confederate-held territory were free. This idea had been introduced by Lincoln as early as August 1862, but he was encouraged to hold back until the Union (the Northen States) were sure of victory. Although this did not end slavery everywhere, it changed the purpose of the war to include ending slavery, and led to the 13th Amendment in 1865, which formally abolished slavery in the United States. The Emancipation Proclamation transformed the Civil War into a struggle for human liberty and paved the way for total abolition of slavery in the United States.
