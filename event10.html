<h1> American Revolution and the Constitution</h1>
<h2>1803 – Marbury v. Madison </h2>

<p>
During Thomas Jefferson’s presidency, his administration sought to reduce federal power, but Chief Justice John Marshall worked to increase the authority of the Supreme Court. Marbury v. Madison was a trial that occurred in 1803 after Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison refused to deliver federal commissions to several Federalist justices appointed by John Adams at the end of his presidency. Although the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Jefferson, Chief Justice Marshall went further in his decision and ruled that the Supreme Court reserved the right to decide whether and act of Congress violated the Constitution. This decision established the principle of judicial review, giving the Supreme Court the power to interpret the Constitution and overturn laws that violate it. This greatly expanded the power of the judiciary branch and strengthened the federal government overall, which went directly against Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican desire for weaker centralized power. It also established the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, above any law passed by Congress.
