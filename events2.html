<h2>1662 – December 1662 Virginia Colonial Law on Race</h2>

<p>
In December 1662, about four decades after the first ship carrying enslaved Africans landed in Virginia, the colony passed the Colonial Law on Race. This law declared that any child born to an enslaved mother would also be enslaved at birth, regardless of the father’s status. This reversed the English tradition that a child’s status followed that of the father. As a result, slavery became hereditary and race-based, and the population of enslaved Africans in North America naturally increased along with the exploitation of female slaves by white planters or other men. This law helped create a society and economy that was deeply dependent on enslaved labor. By the time the Revolution occurred, slavery was so embedded in colonial life that the Constitution protected it through laws like the Three-Fifths Compromise in 1787.
