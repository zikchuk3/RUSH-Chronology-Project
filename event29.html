<h2>1942 – Japanese Internment </h2>

<p>
On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized the forced removal of all persons deemed a threat to national security from the West Coast into “military areas”. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in 1941, anti-Japanese sentiment and national security fears had heightened in the United States. Executive Order 9066 led to the incarceration of over 120,000 people of Japanese descent, 3/4th of which were citizens, into “Internment Camps”, which often had horrible conditions and mistreatment. Many people of Japanese descent were incarcerated based on their national origin alone, showing the United States’ willingness to prioritize racial prejudice and national security over constitutional rights. In December 1944, the Roosevelt Administration declared the use of “military necessity” for relocation over, but it wasn’t until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that discrimination based on race and national origin was prohibited.
