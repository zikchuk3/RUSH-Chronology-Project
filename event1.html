<h1> American Revolution and the Constitution</h1>
<h2>1619 – Landing of the Lion</h2>

<p>
In 1619, a ship named the “White Lion” full of captured Africans landed in the Virginia colony, marking the day the first of many ships carrying enslaved African Americans would land in North America. This moment is considered the start of the chattel slavery system in America, the system where enslaved people were treated as property of their owners. It also highlights how anti-blackness and slavery were codified into colonial America. A few decades later in 1662, Virginia passed the Colonial Law on Race, which enforced hereditary slavery and ensured no one could get out of the system.  The Landing of the Lion and the events that follow highlight how slavery became deeply woven into the colonies’ economic and political systems, especially in the South. When the Constitution was written, slavery was protected through compromises such as the Three-Fifths Compromise, showing how foundational slavery had become to the new nation.
