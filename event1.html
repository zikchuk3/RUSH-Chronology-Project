<h2>1619 – Landing of the Lion</h2>

<p>
In 1619, a ship named the Lion landed at the colonies in Virginia with several enslaved people aboard. The crew sold 
some of these people as laborers/slaves to serve the Virginia colony. This marks the first time British colonizers of North America
enslaved people of African descent.
