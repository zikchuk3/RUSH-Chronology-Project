<h1> American Revolution and the Constitution</h1>
<h2>1765 – Stamp Act Congress</h2>

<p>
The Stamp Act Congress met in October 1765 after the backlash from the Stamp Act, which was a British tax on all paper documents. British American colonists were required to purchase stamped paper from government officials. This directly affected numerous groups, which sparked major popular resistance. As a result of the resistance, the Stamp Act Congress was formed of 9 out of 13 delegates from the colonies and delivered the “Declaration of Rights and Grievances” to British Parliament. The Congress declared that British American colonists were entitled to the same rights as British citizens, there should be “no taxation without representation”, and that there will be colonial boycotts on trade with Britain. This event marked the first time that representatives from multiple colonies came together to oppose British policy, which helped pave the way for future unified action such as the Continental Congress. The concept of “no taxation without representation” continued to be a concept many protesters used for events such as the Boston Tea Party, where colonists resisted British taxes on tea.
