<h1> Race in America</h1>
<h2>1920 – Harlem Renaissance </h2>

<p>
The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural revolution that took place primarly in Harlem, New York during the 1920s to 1930s. During the Great Migration of the 1910s-1930s, many Black Southerners migrated North to urban areas in the North with high populations of Black people, one of those places being Harlem, New York. This brought together a mass of African Americans who were energized by racial pride and celebrated Black art, music, literature, and more. The Harlem Renaissance showed cultural resistance within the American empire and how African Americans were able to find humanity in a system made to discriminate and dehumanize them.
