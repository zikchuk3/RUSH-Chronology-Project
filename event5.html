<h2>1770 – Boston Massacre</h2>

<p>
The Boston Massacre occurred on March 5, 1770, where soldiers fired into a mob of British American colonists gathered outside the Custom House in Boston, killing 5 colonists. The confrontation began colonists were protesting the presence of British troops, who had been stationed in Boston to enforce the Townshend Acts of 1767. These acts were designed to raise revenue after the Seven Years’ War and assert Parliament’s control over the colonies, which angered many colonists. The confrontation intensified anti-parliament sentiment and contributed to growing unity among the colonies. This event connects to the rise of print culture, and colonial printers and artists were able to the distribute the news and propaganda depicting the British soldiers as violent oppressors on innocent colonists. This helped spread revolutionary ideas quickly and encouraged more widespread protest. The Boston Massacre shows how communication and public opinion played a key role in shaping the movement toward independence.
