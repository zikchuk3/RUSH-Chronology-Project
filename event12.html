<h1> American Empire</h1>
<h2>1823 – Monroe Doctrine</h2>

<p>
The Monroe Doctrine, issued in 1823, was a U.S. foreign policy stating that European nations would no longer be permitted to colonize or interfere in the Western Hemisphere. Developed under President James Monroe and greatly influenced by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, it warned that European intervention would be viewed as a threat to U.S. security. This doctrine connects to the concept of American exceptionalism, as it asserted the United States’ unique right to protect and influence the Americas. It also laid the foundation for later expansionist policies such as the Roosevelt Corollary, which justified U.S. intervention in Latin America by claiming it was to prevent European intervention. The Monroe Doctrine established the United States as the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere, reflecting the growth of American imperial power.
