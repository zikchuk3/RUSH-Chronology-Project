<h1> Race in America</h1>
<h2>1857 – Dred Scott v. Sandford </h2>

<p>
In 1857, the Supreme Court ruled in <i>Dred Scott v. Sandford</i> that African Americans were not considered citizens of the United States and could therefore be transported as chattel from any state to another, regardless of state law. It also ruled that Dred Scott, a Missouri slave, had no right to sue the U.S. courts because he was not considered a citizen. This decision was a direct rejection of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that proposed slavery to be abolished above the 36°30′ dividing line in the Louisiana Purchase lands, which had upset many pro-slavery Americans who wanted to expand slavery to the American territories. <i>Dred Scott v. Sandford</i> signaled a commitment by the Federal government to extend slavery as far and wide as it might want.
