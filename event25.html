<h2>1865 – Thirteenth Amendment  </h2>

<p>
The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified on January 31,1865, by President Abraham Lincoln following the Civil War. This Amendment made the goals of the Emancipation Proclamation permanent by formally abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States, with the exception of punishment for a crime. By the end of the year, 3/4ths of the states had approved the amendment, and 4 million people were forever free from slavery that had existed for more than two centuries. The Thirteenth Amendment laid the groundwork for later civil rights struggles during the Reconstruction Era after the civil war and in the later future.
