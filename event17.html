<h1> American Empire</h1>
<h2>1945 – Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima</h2>

<p>
On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians. Three days later, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, resulting in approximately 80,000 additional civilian deaths. These bombings connect to the Manhattan Project, a program that was to harness atomic energy and create an atomic bomb that could level entire cities, which demonstrated the United States’ technological and military dominance during World War II. The atomic bombings highlight American imperial power by showing how the United States used unprecedented military force to end the war and establish itself as a global superpower.
