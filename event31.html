<h1> Race in America</h1>
<h2>1965 – Voting Rights Act   </h2>

<p>
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on August 6, 1965, to address racial discrimination in voting. It abolished voting discrimination in federal, state, and local elections. The act was a direct result of the coverage “Bloody Sunday” in March 1965, when peaceful protesters attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, on behalf of African American voting rights but were violently attacked by white law enforcement. The Voting Rights Act directly addressed the limits of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and strengthened American democracy by ensuring that everyone would be able to exercise their right to vote.
