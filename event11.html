<h1> American Empire</h1>
<h2>1803 – Louisiana Purchase</h2>

<p>
In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson purchased the Louisiana Territory from France for $15 million dollars, equivalent to about $200 million dollars today. This purchase would go on to be known as the “Louisiana Purchase” and is considered the largest real estate deal in American History. A large factor for why this large piece of land was sold to America was because of the Haitian Revolution, where slaves in Haiti rebelled against the French and defeated French forces, stripping Napoleon of his ability to control Haiti which was the home of profitable. The pressures of the Haitian Revolution and the pressures of France’s ongoing wars in Europe forced Napoleon to rethink his vast American holdings, thus he decided to sell the entire Louisiana Territory to the United States. The Louisiana Purchase set the United States on a course of westward expansion across North America.
