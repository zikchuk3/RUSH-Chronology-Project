<h1> American Empire</h1>
<h2>1890 – Wounded Knee Massacre</h2>

<p>
The Wounded Knee Massacre occurred on December 29, 1890, when U.S. soldiers killed between 150 and 300 Lakota men, women, and children in South Dakota. The violence took place during an attempt to disarm Lakota people who were forcibly escorted to Wounded Knee Creek. This event connects directly to the Ghost Dance movement, a peaceful Native American spiritual revival that emerged in response to the Dawes General Allotment Act of 1887, which stripped Native nations of land, sovereignty, and traditional ways of life. The Ghost Dance offered hope through ritual dances, visions of a renewed Earth, and prophecies of white settlers vanishing, and U.S. officials misinterpreted this as a threat. The Wounded Knee Massacre demonstrates American expansion by showing how the U.S. government used violence to suppress Indigenous autonomy and enforce control over conquered lands, and marked the end of sustained, armed, Native American resistance on the Plains.
