<h2>1882 – Chinese Exclusion Act   </h2>

<p>
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 prohibited Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States for a period of 10 years. The act was passed due to intense economic competition, racial prejudice, and anti-immigration sentiment due to Chinese Laborers coming to the U.S. and working jobs for lower pay. It was also a revision of the Angell Treaty, which allowed the United States to restrict Chinese Immigration, and the Burlingame-Seward Treaty between the United States and China, where China agreed to limit immigration to the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act reflected widespread anti-Chinese sentiment and was the first federal law to ban immigration based solely on race and national in the United States, paving the way for other anti-immigration laws.
