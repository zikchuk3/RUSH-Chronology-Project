<h1> Race in America</h1>
<h2>1964 – Civil Rights Act  </h2>

<p>
On July 2, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in response to widespread racial segregation and discrimination in the United States. The act outlawed segregation in public accommodations and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or national origin. The passing of the act was the result of years of activism, including protests, boycotts, and more, during the Civil Rights Movement that had begun 10 years earlier. The Civil Rights Act marked a major step in expanding equality within the United States and is considered amongst the most important pieces of civil rights legislation in American History.
