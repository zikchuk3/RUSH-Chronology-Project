<h2>1924 – National Origins Act </h2>

<p>
The National Origins Act of 1924 restricted immigration in the United States by establishing quotas based on nationality. This was a permanent measure of the former emergency Immigration Act, which acted as a stopgap Immigration measure. The number of immigrants annually admitted to the United States from each nation was restricted to 2 percent of the population who had come from that country and resided in the United States in 1890, which favored immigrants from Northern and Southern Europe while making it hard for others to enter the United States. This law was an expansion of earlier immigration restrictions such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was the first federal anti-immigration law based on the country. The National Origins Act is what established immigration policy in the American Empire.
