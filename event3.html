<h2>1763 – Royal Proclamation Line of 1763</h2>

<p>
After Pontiac’s War, a conflict in which Native American groups fought against British expansion, British officials recognized that peace in the West would require royal protection of Native American lands. So, on October 7, 1763, the British Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which created a boundary line along the Appalachian Mountains. This line was meant to keep the British American colonists from expanding westward into Native lands. This marked the end of Britain’s salutary neglect, where the colonies were mostly left to govern themselves. After the Seven Years’ War and Pontiac’s War, Britain began enforcing stricter control and issuing more regulations, which angered many of the colonists. This event connects to later British acts such as the Quartering Act and the Stamp Act, which also imposed limits and new rules on the colonists. The Proclmation shows how the British government prioritized imperial control over the interests of the colonists, which fueled tension and contributed to the rise of colonial resistance that eventually led to the American Revolution.
