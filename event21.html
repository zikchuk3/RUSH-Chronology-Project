<h2>1831 – Nat Turner’s Rebellion </h2>

<p>
On the morning of August 22, 1831, in Southampton County, Virginia, Nat Turner and 6 other men attempted to free the region’s enslaved population, and this would go on to be known as “Nat Turner’s Rebellion.” Nat Turner claimed that he had been called to do the work of God and led the deadliest slave rebellion in the antebellum South. By the end of that day, Turner and what had grown to be more than 50 other men had killed 57 white men, women, and children on 11 farms. The rebellion increased Southerners’ fears of enslaved resistance and led to harsher anti-literacy laws and increased the tensions leading up to the Succession of the Southern States and the Civil War.
