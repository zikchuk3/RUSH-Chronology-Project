<h2>1800 – Election of 1800</h2>

<p>
The Election of 1800 occurred after John Adams’ presidency had disappointed many Americans, leading to a tense and highly polarized political environment. The election contested between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans, with both sides believing that disaster and possibly war would come if the other won. Ultimately, the election resulted in a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, both Democratic-Republicans, and the decision was sent to the House of Representatives, which took 36 ballots before Jefferson won.  This exposed major flaws in the original Electoral College system that would later be changed in the 12th Amendment of the Constitution. The Election of 1800 resulted in the first peaceful transfer of power between political parties in the U.S., showing that political change could occur without violence. The Election also demonstrated that political parties had become a permanent and influential part of American democracy. Despite Adams’s and Jefferson’s attempts to tame party politics, the tension between federal power and the liberties of states and individuals would exist long into the 19th century.
