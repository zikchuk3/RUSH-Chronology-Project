<h2>1776 – Declaration of Independence</h2>

<p>
The Declaration of Independence was ratified on July 4, 1776, about one year into the American Revolutionary War, and announced that the thirteen American colonies were breaking away from Britain and had united to form one nation. This officially severed political ties with Britan and established the United States as an independent nation. The Declaration of Independence introduced ideals such as “all men are created equal” and that they are endowed unalienable rights including “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” The document provided the foundation for the Revolutionary War and justified the colonies’ decision to separate from British rule. It laid out the base of what was ratified in the Treaty of Paris (1783), in which all nations officially recognized the United States as an independent nation after the war ended. The Declaration’s principles also influenced the creation of documents such as the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The Declaration of Independence connects to Enlightenment thinker John Locke, who argued that governments must protect natural rights and citizens have the right to overthrow oppressive governments.
