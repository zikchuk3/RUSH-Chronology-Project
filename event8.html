<h1> American Revolution and the Constitution</h1>
<h2>1787 – Constitutional Convention</h2>

<p>
The Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from May to September 1787 and included 55 delegates from 12 of the 13 states. The goal of the convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation, which had been proven as too weak to govern effectively, but the delegates ultimately decided to create an entirely new system of government. The result was the U.S, Constitution, which established a stronger federal government. This meeting established the core structure of the American government that still exists today. The delegates agreed on a system with three branches (legislative, executive, and judicial) and designed checks and balances so no branch could dominate the others. The Great Compromise also created bicameral legislature, balancing the needs of both large and small states.
